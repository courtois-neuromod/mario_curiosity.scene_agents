## Installation instructions

First, make sure you have Python 3.10 installed.
```
python --version
```
or 
```
python3 --version

If these lines return Python 3.10 we're good to go.

Else, we suggest installing pyenv to manage several Python versions, and select Python 3.10 for the local directory : 
```

```

Create environment :
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
